# Task 1: Heart Disease Classification
# Description
The "Heart Disease Analysis" project is a data analysis and classification initiative that aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on a variety of patient characteristics. The research aims to construct a machine learning model for early identification and risk assessment of heart disease using a dataset combining demographic, clinical, and laboratory information of patients.

# Dataset

# Task 2: Air Pollution PM2.5 Prediction
# Description
The "Air Pollution PM2.5 Analysis and Prediction" initiative analyses and predicts fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in the air. PM2.5 is a major air pollutant made up of microscopic particles that can enter the respiratory system and cause health problems. This study intends to gather insights into PM2.5 concentration patterns and trends, identify variables influencing its levels, and construct a forecast model for future PM2.5 levels.

# Major Project: Customer Segmentation and Predictive Modelling.
# Description
This projects deal with the segmentation of the customers based on the their spending behaviour . This segmentation of customers can be much better insights for the bussiness decision making and strategy building.
This project also deals with the prediction of the annual spending of the customer based on their past purchases.
